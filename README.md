# Project Title
Project: Create a Token
# Description
This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has two functions, a mint function that increases the total supply and the balance of the sender address, and a burn function that subtracts the total supply and the balance of the sender address. This program serves as a simple and straightforward introduction to Solidity programming, and can be used as a stepping stone for more complex projects in the future.
